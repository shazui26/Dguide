my capstone project for my final year as student taking the course bachelor of in information technology

to make this app run, you need to create a[ mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) account to get a token and a firebase acount for
it's realtime database.

this app can geotag a place within the map, save it to the database and dislay it to the map interface
it can also be for offline navigation and search 
for suggestions and improvements you can contact me @ sharwinc31@gmail.com
